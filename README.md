# Paranomal Investigators App


Ghost Pals Inc are a paranormal investigation business. They take reports from members of the public and input them into their table of reported hauntings 
They assess the type of haunting and decide how to proceed to help the reporter/ghost

## MVP
--  add a haunting
--  keep track of hauntings: location, type of ghost, date, description of incident
--  keep track of services: what type of ghost- quelling was carried out, was it successful, date, how much was the customer billed, who carried it out

## Nice to haves
--  calculate which ghosts are the hardest to calm down
--  assign an investigator to a haunting
--  keep track of revenue - which types of ghost/locations are the most lucrative


## Even nicer to haves
-- map with hauntings on
-- separate portals for customers and investigators to look at relevant information to them.
